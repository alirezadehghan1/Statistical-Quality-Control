# Statistical Quality Control

This project involved using Minitab statistical software to analyze quality control data and and monitor manufacturing processes. Various statistical techniques like hypothesis testing, control charts, and capability analysis were implemented to assess process stability, normality, trends, and capability. The analyses provided actionable insights to improve quality by detecting special causes of variation and bringing processes into a state of statistical control. Quality control charts including Xbar-R, Xbar-S, I-MR, NP, Cusum were created to assess process stability and identify out of control conditions. Capability analysis, and process capability indices were leveraged to conduct the statistical process control.
The project demonstrates proficiency in utilizing statistical methods and Minitab tools for quality control and process improvement in industrial contexts. The statistical analysis provides insights into process performance to identify areas for enhancing quality and reducing defects.
